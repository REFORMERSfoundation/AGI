BENIGN AGI


AI-complete  specialized yes/no problem solver of NP-complete class.
AI-hard  specialist open-ended double-exponential NP-hard problem.
Benign to humankind endowed with specialist knowledge.

Our metamathematical P=NP theorem indicates  that brute force is no longer applicable in search 
computational power; brute force is not the way of the future; the real future lies on intelligent
superior language techniques and applications embedded in it and in it only.

In contradistinction, the classic exponential growth ratio of Mooreâ€™s law is now being replaced 
and rendered obsolete by our named result, for the future is now a double exponential growth ratio.

The advent of our metamathematical P=NP theorem is a display asserting language is the true power of computation. 
This discovery allows us to delve deeply into safe language hierarchies and security protocols to safeward humans 
from any potential logic-language loopholes machine are guarantee to discover, moreover, it allows us to drastically 
advance in the development of AGI-ASI technology decades before any reasonable time-table prediction.
